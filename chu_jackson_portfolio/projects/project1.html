                        <h2>Background</h2>
                        <p><b><i>MediArt Family Clinic</i></b> is a small healthcare provider located in Bellevue, WA. Their mission is to offer personalized, high-quality medical care, whether preventative or as needed. The clinic is run by a passionate team that values trust, comfort, and a family-first approach to healthcare.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="section-block right">
                        <h2>Problem</h2>
                        <p>The clinic's website lacked the visual and structural credibility expected of a healthcare provider. It relied heavily on generic stock images, featured redundant content, and had an inconsistent layout, resulting in a cluttered and unprofessional appearance. Additionally, the website was missing a “Request Appointment” page, which was an essential feature for user convenience and efficient clinic operations.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="section-block left">
                        <h2>Process</h2>
                        <p>To restore trust and improve usability, I began by replacing the low-quality Google stock images with high-resolution, original photos that reflected the clinic's welcoming atmosphere. I streamlined the site's layout to remove redundant content, introduced consistent formatting, and implemented a clean, intuitive navigation menu.
                            The user experience was further enhanced with a dedicated "Request Appointment" page, making it easier for patients to engage with the clinic online. Development was structured over five weeks: starting with research and planning, followed by inspiration gathering, wireframing, and full development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
                            </p>

                    <div class="section-block right">
                        <h2>Results</h2>
                        <p>The redesigned website now projects professionalism and care, just like the clinic itself. It feels modern, clean, and trustworthy. The layout is more responsive, and users can navigate the site effortlessly. Feedback from users highlighted the ease of requesting appointments and the new design's credibility, helping to bridge the gap between first impressions and real-life care.</p>
