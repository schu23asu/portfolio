                        <h2>Background</h2>
                        <p><b><i>Starbucks</i></b> is a globally recognized coffee brand celebrated for its premium beverages. Starbucks began in 1971 in Seattle's Pike Place Market, selling fresh-roasted coffee, tea, and spices. Inspired by Italian coffeehouse culture, the brand transformed into a warm, welcoming café experience. As part of its digital expansion, Starbucks launched its mobile app to offer customers convenient access to ordering, paying, and picking up their favorite drinks with minimal wait.</p>

                    <div class="section-block right">
                        <h2>Problem</h2>
                        <p>While the app offered basic functionality, it lacked a user experience that truly captured the warmth and ease of the in-store experience. The design needed improvement in usability, visual cohesion, and personalization to better reflect the brand and improve engagement. The goal of the redesign was to enhance the user interface and overall experience to boost satisfaction, encourage mobile ordering, and deepen customer connection through intuitive and delightful interactions.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="section-block left">
                        <h2>Process</h2>
                        <p>I began by mapping out the user interaction and designing a clear, intuitive navigation tree to streamline the ordering process. I created wireframes to reimagine key workflows and crafted static concept artwork to visualize the improved experience. Visual elements, including color switches, typography, and iconography, were carefully selected to stay true to Starbucks' established brand identity. The redesign focused on creating a frictionless flow from browsing to checkout, enhancing both convenience and visual delight.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="section-block right">
                        <h2>Results</h2>
                        <p>The redesigned app concept presented a more user-friendly and intuitive experience. By simplifying the interface and aligning the visual language with the Starbucks brand, the app now better reflects the company's core values of hospitality, quality, and customer care. The improved design enhances usability, encourages engagement, and provides a stronger foundation for personalized features and future growth.</p>
