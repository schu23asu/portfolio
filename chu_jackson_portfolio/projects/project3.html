                        <h2>Background</h2>
                        <p><b><i>Nirvana</i></b> was an influential American alternative rock band formed in 1987, featuring Kurt Cobain, Krist Novoselic, and later Dave Grohl. With their 1991 album <i>Nevermind</i> and its iconic single "Smells Like Teen Spirit," they brought grunge into the mainstream and became the voice of Generation X. Known for their raw sound and emotionally charged lyrics, Nirvana redefined rock music in the early '90s. Though their time was short, their impact on music and culture remains profound.</p>

                    <div class="section-block right">
                        <h2>Problem</h2>
                        <p>Many band merch sites rely on outdated layouts, clunky forms, or generic templates. The challenge was to design and develop a fully custom merch website that feels modern, interactive, and easy to use. The site needed to look polished, function smoothly, and offer users engaging features like shopping, form validation, and a bit of playful interactivity.</p>

                    <div class="section-block left">
                        <h2>Process</h2>
                        <p>I designed a fixed-width layout at 1280px to emulate the clean, professional look of a modern merch site. The site includes sections for About, Albums, Shop, a “Guess the Number” game, and Contact, all seamlessly connected through smooth navigation. The Albums section features dynamic left/right scroll controls for browsing content, while the Shop includes an interactive cost calculator that updates subtotal, tax, shipping, and total in real time as users add items to their cart. To add a fun, nostalgic twist, I created a number guessing game as a hidden “Easter egg” feature. The Contact Us page includes a fully validated form with real-time input feedback and final confirmation using JavaScript object creation. Additionally, I implemented a light/dark mode toggle to support accessibility and user preferences.</p>

                        <h2>Results</h2>
                        <p>The result is a fully functional and visually compelling Nirvana-themed merch site coded entirely from scratch. The site demonstrates key front-end skills, from layout to DOM manipulation to form validation. It offers a seamless user experience with a touch of rock personality, suitable for any artist, brand, or small business looking to elevate their online store.</p>
